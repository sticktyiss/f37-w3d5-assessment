    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>It's hard to order my interests, but I have always wanted to try.</p>
    <div>
    <ol>
      <li>Anime/manga & its culture</li>
      <li>Board Games</li>
      <li>Spray painting</li>
      <li>3d Printing & Painting</li>
      <li>Video Games</li>
      <li>Woodworking</li>
      <li>Every other craft form</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Most of my interests lie with creative things <br>because I like to use my imagination <br>as often as I can. We live in such <br> a perfectionistic society which <br>adds to my fuel to go against <br>norms in artistic forms.

  <section id="goals">
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>It's taken a while to get to the point where I can decide on something. Due to my plethora of interests I was always conflicted with what I should pursue. I've settled on programming mainly because of physical health issues I've been running into. Luckily, with programming I have a capability of working from home.
    </p>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to own and run my own business, and make money from my hobbies!</p>
